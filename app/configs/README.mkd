# Server APP Configurations

The basic configuration is `app.php`, in order to provide a flexible
configuration base on your environment, you may want to use a soft linked file
instead.

## Secure Notes

Everythings related to your hosting environment, such as database password,
encrypt salt should **not** be added into version control.


## TODO

- [?] `application mode` base configuration loading (i.e., envvar inject)
